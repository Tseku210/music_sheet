This repository is part of the [Khuur](https://github.com/Tseku210/khuur_app) project, a Flutter application for learning and playing the Mongolian horse fiddle instrument (morin khuur). It extends the [simple_sheet_music](https://github.com/tomoyu719/simple_sheet_music) library with MIDI playback capabilities and missing music sheet logic. It adds support for playing sheet music through MIDI output.
